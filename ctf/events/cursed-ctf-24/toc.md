# Cursed CTF '24

## Forward
I only have one writeup for this event. While I did others, the contents of them were very meme-tastic and not much learning was done. Instead, I spent the competition laser focused on this one challenge and learned a ton. As such, I'll do my best to articulate effort and the learnings as detailed as I can be.
