```python

public_source = requests.get('https://ifconfig.co/ip').text

Looking at the diff between the used version and the following version of Gotenberg (https://github.com/gotenberg/gotenberg/compare/v8.0.3...v8.1.0) We can see there is some updates and release notes about read access to the container.


```python
!curl $target/forms/chromium/convert/url -X POST --form url=file:///proc/1/root/etc/flag.txt -o flag.pdf
```

The instance is explicitly a container, so we can assume that pid 1 is the primary service and use proc/pid/root to try to get around the regex matches. 
I believe this is due to regex doing a negative match on [^tmp] (words starting with t, m, or p)
