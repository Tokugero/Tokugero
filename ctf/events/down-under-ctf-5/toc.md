# Down Under CTF

Down Under CTF is a beginner-friendly CTF that is hosted by the Australian National University's Cyber Security Society. The CTF is designed to be accessible to beginners and experienced players alike.

I found this one really difficult, either because it was still me maturing on my note taking platform or because I am out of practice on the challenges I tried.

Either way, I had a lot of fun.
