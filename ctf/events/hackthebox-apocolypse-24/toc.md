# HackTheBox - Apcolypse '24

These writeups are not inclusive of all the challenges I solved or worked on, rather the ones I found I learned the most or found challenging. 

In this event, I felt it was a lot easier to accomplish many of the forensics ones but wanted to focus on learning skills around reverse engineering and byte-code debugging; as such I spent most of my TIME in those challenges, even if most of the points came form elsewhere.

Hope you enjoy my struggles as much as I did!

## How I generated the writeups

**User**

Please generate a short disclaimer, 2 paragraphs, explaining how this content was created based on the prompts I gave you.

**ChatGPT**

Disclaimer:

The content provided in this write-up was generated based on verbal transcriptions provided by the user. The transcriptions were explanations of a security capture the flag event, detailing the steps taken to analyze the challenge and uncover the hidden flag. The text was rewritten in a security write-up format, adhering to the user's instructions regarding tone, audience level, and markdown formatting.

It's important to note that while efforts were made to accurately convey the essence of the transcriptions, the final write-up may not capture every nuance or detail present in the original verbal explanations. Additionally, the inclusion of steps, inferences, and instructional pieces was based on the user's guidance to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the analysis process. Readers should approach the content with the understanding that it is a distilled representation of the original verbal transcriptions, tailored to fit a specific format and audience.

### Human Editor Notes
I didn't have the heart to break it to ChatGPT that I didn't like everything it translated, and added a few human edits as well. Images and terminal output are also directly my own, as is this message. I continue to evolve my usage of AI/NLP to assist in my writing, but I'm not quite ready to let it take over completely. Also Github copilot likes to eat some of my text and make some great suggestions periodically as well, so that might slip in too.
