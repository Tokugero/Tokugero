# Hello!

### Welcome to an extension of my blog.
I needed a place that was a bit more scalable to keep my write-ups of technical research, for now only in the form of CaptureTheFlag style documentation on challenges from which I learned. This is mostly tailored to be for me to read in the future when I inevitably forget how to solve a `printf` challenge, or use foundry. 

However, maybe you can find some use in these too as you explore older challenges or need more perspectives to debug with GDB or fight against a proxy that won't let you past.

Good luck on your challenges and thank you for reading,
